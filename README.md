# 📈 Retail Demand Forecasting Dashboard

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts daily retail sales for Rossmann stores using an optimized **XGBoost Regressor**. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment through an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Retail demand forecasting is essential for inventory planning, workforce management, and business decision-making. This project leverages historical Rossmann Store Sales data to build a high-performance regression model capable of accurately predicting future daily sales.

The application allows users to:
- Select a store
- Choose a prediction date
- Configure promotion and holiday information
- Generate sales predictions instantly
- View engineered features used for prediction
- Download the generated feature vector
- Track prediction history within the session

# 🤖 Models Evaluated

The following regression models were trained and compared:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|------|------:|------:|------:|
| Linear Regression | 573.45 | 823.82 | 0.9546 |
| Decision Tree | 464.63 | 736.25 | 0.9637 |
| Gradient Boosting | 489.83 | 727.47 | 0.9646 |
| Random Forest | 297.16 | 476.88 | 0.9848 |
| XGBoost | 285.44 | 441.67 | 0.9869 |

---

# 🏆 Final Model

After hyperparameter tuning using **RandomizedSearchCV**, the optimized XGBoost model achieved:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------:|
| MAE | **269.64** |
| RMSE | **418.95** |
| R² Score | **0.9882** |

The model explains approximately **98.8% of the variance** in daily retail sales.
